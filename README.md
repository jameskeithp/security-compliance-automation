Problem Description

Modern organizations are confronted with an expansive and dynamic landscape of security threats. Continuously ensuring that systems and data adhere to security standards is paramount. The goal here is to use AWS Security Hub and/or Azure Security Center to not only detect threats but also provide automated steps for remediation.
AWS Security Hub Implementation
Step 1: Activate AWS Security Hub

    Login to AWS Management Console.
    Navigate to AWS Security Hub and enable it.

Step 2: Integrate with Other AWS Services

    Ensure integration with services like Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie.
    Configure these services to relay findings to Security Hub.

Step 3: Configure Automated Scanning

    Use AWS Config to evaluate resource configurations against best practices.
    Implement relevant managed Config Rules or devise custom rules.

Step 4: Set Up Vulnerability Management

    Incorporate Amazon Inspector to consistently scan EC2 instances for vulnerabilities.

Step 5: Create Remediation Workflows

    Utilize AWS Lambda for creating automated remediation workflows.
    Use Amazon CloudWatch Events (or EventBridge) to spot findings, triggering a Lambda function for remediation.

Azure Security Center Implementation
Step 1: Enable Azure Security Center

    Access the Azure Portal.
    Navigate to Azure Security Center and activate the Standard tier.

Step 2: Integrate with Other Azure Services

    Azure Security Center integrates with Azure Policy. Define and enforce policies accordingly.

Step 3: Configure Automated Scanning

    Make sure Azure Security Center assesses your resources for vulnerabilities.

Step 4: Set Up Vulnerability Management

    Check Azure Security Center's Secure Score for security posture insights. Regularly implement recommendations.
    Employ integrated vulnerability assessment tools, like Qualys.

Step 5: Create Remediation Workflows

    Use Azure Logic Apps for automated remediation workflows.
    Trigger Logic Apps based on security alerts or recommendations.

Lambda Code for AWS Remediation

For AWS, we've provided a simple Lambda function that rectifies a publicly accessible S3 bucket. You can find the code under the lambda/ directory. This is just a simple illustration; in real scenarios, more advanced error-handling and potentially human intervention might be required before auto-remediation.
Deployment Instructions

    Deploy the Lambda Function:
        Navigate to AWS Lambda Console.
        Create a new Lambda function using the provided code.
        Assign the function permissions to adjust S3 bucket ACLs.

    Setup CloudWatch Events Trigger:
        Go to CloudWatch Events (or EventBridge).
        Craft a rule triggered by Security Hub findings related to public S3 buckets.
        Set the rule's target as the Lambda function.

    Testing:
        Publicize an S3 bucket.
        Await Security Hub's detection of the misconfiguration.
        On detection, the Lambda function should fire, making the bucket private.
        Verify remediation by checking CloudWatch logs for the Lambda function.
